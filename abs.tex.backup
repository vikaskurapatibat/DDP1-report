\begin{Abstract}
A method of simulating multi phase flows including surface tension is presented. The approach uses the concept of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics(SPH). Several possible implementations of surface tension forces are studied. The methods presented here apply to problems involving arbitrary shape undergoing deformations within a two-phase system and readily extended to three dimensional problems.
