\begin{Abstract}

Multiphase flows are encountered often in day-to-day life like mixing of two liquids etc., For many such flows, the interaction at the surface is important. In this work, multiphase flows' interaction is studies with emphasis of surface tension in SPH.\\

Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics(SPH) is a mesh-free Lagrangian particle method which is now used in various fields like astrophysics, fluid mechanics and solid dynamics. This SPH method has been used to solve the problems of surface tension. To do this, the important issue to be addressed is the calculation of interface accurately. Grid based schemes which interfactial tracking or interface capturing techniques cause issues in mass conservation, curvature capturing and interface diffusion. So, this work tries to overcome these using a grid-free scheme in Smoothed-Particle Hydronamics.
